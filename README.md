### RPG-Project (Still in Development)
This is a 3D RPG game with low-poly graphics, where players can set out on quests, battle a variety of enemies, and explore a vast open world. Players can level up their characters by defeating enemies and completing quests. Along the way, they can collect resources, craft items, and upgrade their equipment to become more powerful.

### Roadmap (Short-term)
* Completing the inventory system
* AI integration for combat
* NPC System

**Note:** This repository doesn't include the assets those I don't hold the right to distrubute. You have to acquire the assets to properly run the game in Unity. I will publish the name of the assets list after game completes. If you have the rights to use the assets I can share the my asset submodule folder for easier access.
